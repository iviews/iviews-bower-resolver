Make sure that the following files in your project are similar to what is shown here:

## .bowerrc

Include `{{package.name}}` in your`.bowerrc` file to tell Bower that it should use this resolver for the dependencies defined in `bower.json`:

{{example 'examples/example-project/.bowerrc'}}

## bower.json

Add a reference to an i-views dependency in your `bower.json`. The version is specified by the reference part, e.g. `#5.0.4`.
If no version is given then the latest version will be automatically downloaded by Bower.

{{example 'examples/example-project/bower.json'}}

When you run

```
bower install
```

the resolver will download the `viewconfigmapper` from the i-views download servers.
